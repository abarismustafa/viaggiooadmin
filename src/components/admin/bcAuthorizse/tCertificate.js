                <p>We at RNFI Services are committed to extending financial services to the underserved segments of our society, thereby promoting financial inclusion. Our Business Correspondent Agents (BCAs), also known as Retail Agents, are at the forefront of this mission, offering essential banking services such as cash deposits and withdrawals directly to the end customers' bank accounts.</p>
                <p>Our BCAs are empowered to deposit cash into RNFI Services' account, upon which a corresponding pre-determined limit is allocated to them. This limit enables the BCAs to facilitate cash deposit services for customers within the regulatory confines established by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Functioning akin to a mobile bank counter, our BCAs collect modest cash deposits from customers and initiate deposit transactions through our associated Bank. The associated Bank then diligently processes these transactions, adhering to the compliance with RBI guidelines, rules and regulations.</p>
                <p>To maintain operational fluidity, BCAs are required to pre-deposit funds into RNFI Services' account with the associated banks. This advance deposit secures a pre-funded limit. Following each customer deposit transaction, the BCA's limit is adjusted accordingly. The cash collected from customers is then redeposited by the BCAs into RNFI Services' account to restore their transactional capacity.</p>
